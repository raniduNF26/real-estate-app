Real Estate Finder & Appointment Booking Application
Welcome to the Real Estate Finder & Appointment Booking Application! This project provides a comprehensive platform for users to find real estate agents, browse properties, and schedule appointments seamlessly. Built with a focus on efficiency and user experience, the application leverages modern web technologies and optimized data structures to deliver a responsive and intuitive interface.

Introduction
In today's fast-paced real estate market, connecting clients with the right agents and properties efficiently is key. This application addresses that need by offering a robust solution that simplifies the agent search, property viewing, and appointment scheduling processes. Whether you're a buyer, seller, or an agent, this platform aims to streamline your real estate journey.

Features
Agent Finder: Quickly search and discover real estate agents based on various criteria.

Property Browser: Explore a diverse portfolio of properties with detailed listings.

Appointment Booking: Effortlessly schedule appointments with agents for property viewings or consultations.

User Management: Secure user authentication and authorization for different roles (e.g., clients, agents, admins).

Agent Rating System: View and sort agents based on their ratings to find the best fit.

Admin Panel: A dedicated interface for administrators to manage users, agents, properties, and overall system settings.

Technologies Used
This application is built upon a robust and widely-adopted technology stack, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance:

Backend:

Java: The core programming language.

Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building robust, stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration.

Frontend:

HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and ensuring a responsive, aesthetically pleasing user interface.

Thymeleaf: A modern server-side Java template engine used for rendering dynamic HTML content seamlessly integrated with Spring Boot.


 Core Data Structures & Algorithms
To ensure the application's efficiency and responsiveness, particularly in handling agent and property data, several key data structures and algorithms have been implemented:

Binary Search Tree (BST):

Used for the efficient storage and retrieval of Agent data.

Provides logarithmic time complexity (O(logn)) for search, insertion, and deletion operations in the average case, making agent lookups and management extremely fast.

Auxiliary Maps:

Employed alongside the BST to facilitate quick lookups for agents based on specific attributes (e.g., location, specialization).

These maps enable rapid filtering and retrieval, complementing the BST's ordered structure.

Optimized Search and Delete Operations:

The implementation includes internal optimizations for search and delete operations within the BST, ensuring efficient data manipulation even with large datasets.

Selection Sort:

Utilized to sort agents by their ratings. While O(n^2 ) in complexity, it's suitable for scenarios where stability is preferred or the number of agents to be sorted by rating is not excessively large, providing a clear, intuitive sorting mechanism.
